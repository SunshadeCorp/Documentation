# easyBMS

easyBMS is a battery management system for used second life batteries from electric vehicles for solar energy installations.
Currently, easyBMS integrates primarily with Volkswagen MEB batteries, both 8s and 12s types, and Sungrow Hybrid inverters.
The battery management system consists of two parts: The BMS slaves and the BMS master together with a monitoring application.
